# Contributing a plugin

This document is the step-by-step submission and review process for
`nginxui/plugins`. Read `README.md` first for the catalog's shape and the
trust levels referenced below.

## Prerequisites

Before you submit, your plugin should have:

- A public GitHub repository with at least one **GitHub Release** whose tag
  looks like `v1.0.0` (SemVer) and whose assets include the packaged
  `.tar.gz` your plugin builds: either the portable `<id>-<version>.tar.gz`,
  or one `<id>-<version>-<goos>-<goarch>.tar.gz` per platform, or both (see
  [Packaging](https://nginxui.com/plugin/packaging) for the archive layout).
- A `plugin.json` that passes `nginx-ui plugin lint` and, for a plugin with a
  `server` block, `nginx-ui plugin conformance` — the same two commands
  `.github/workflows/validate.yml` runs against your release.
- A plugin `id` that follows the naming rule in `README.md`
  (`io.github.<owner>.<name>` if you have no domain of your own). `id` must
  never start with `com.nginxui.`, which is reserved for plugins the
  nginx-ui project maintains itself.
- A primary key and a signing key it certified, made once with
  `nginx-ui plugin key init --id <your plugin id>`. Every package carries
  `plugin.sums`, its signature `plugin.sums.minisig` by the signing key and
  the certificate `plugin.signer` and `plugin.signer.minisig` at its root;
  `nginx-ui plugin pack --key signing.key` writes all of them, see
  `docs/signing.md`. A package without a signature is unsigned and installs
  only on a host in developer mode.

## Submission path 1: the developer portal

Sign in to the [developer portal](https://portal.nginxui.com/submit) with
GitHub and submit your repository. The portal drafts `plugins/<id>.json`
from your newest release: the id and the names come from its `plugin.json`,
the license from your repository, the categories from your choice or the
capabilities of the plugin. The names are reviewed in every language, and
none may claim to be official.

The portal opens a pull request with the draft, so it is checked the way any
pull request is, see
[What `.github/workflows/validate.yml` checks](#what-githubworkflowsvalidateyml-checks).
The portal shows the result, what the listing will show and the state of the
review, and notifies you when a maintainer approves, asks for changes or
declines. A maintainer reviews it there, see [Review and merge](#review-and-merge).
Once it is merged the deploy lists your plugin, and the portal shows it as
live. From then on you change the listing, its store texts and screenshots
and its releases in the portal.

The repository has to agree to be listed. The submission checks that you own
it, that you are a public member of the organization that owns it, or that it
has the `nginx-ui-plugin` topic, which only its administrators can set.
Otherwise a maintainer confirms it with the owners before approving.

## Submission path 2: a pull request

Fork this repository and add `plugins/<id>.json` yourself — copy the shape of
an existing entry such as `plugins/com.nginxui.dns01.json`, or validate
against `schema/entry.schema.json` directly. Open a pull request. The entry
lists no releases: they are read from your GitHub Releases (see below).

Required fields and what they mean are documented in
`schema/entry.schema.json`; in particular:

- `name` is a locale map of the reviewed names, `{ "en": "...", "zh_CN": "..." }`.
  Everything else the listing shows comes from the `plugin.json` of your
  newest stable release, see [What your releases change](#what-your-releases-change):
  leave `description`, `homepage_url`, `readme_url`, `icon_url` and
  `screenshots` out unless you need to override it.
- `trust` for a submission is always `"community"`. `verified` is reserved
  for partner organizations, see [Partner plugins](#partner-plugins).
- `repository_url` is the GitHub repository whose Releases publish the
  plugin. Each release carries its packages, the portable
  `<id>-<version>.tar.gz` or one `<id>-<version>-<goos>-<goarch>.tar.gz` per
  platform with a `.sha256` file next to each, see
  [Packaging](https://nginxui.com/plugin/packaging). The signature lives
  inside each package.
- `author_public_key` is required for a `community` entry. It is your
  primary public key, `primary.pub` from `nginx-ui plugin key init`, which
  certifies the signing keys of your packages.
- `revoked_signers` lists the ids of signing keys you withdrew, see
  [Withdrawing a signing key](#withdrawing-a-signing-key).
- `categories` is optional: one to three ids from the `category` list of
  `schema/entry.schema.json`, such as `certificates` or `logs`. The
  marketplace and the catalog site translate them and filter by them.
- `screenshots` overrides the screenshots of your `plugin.json`: up to eight
  images, each an `https` `url` of a PNG, JPEG or WebP file with an optional
  `dark_url` and `caption` locale map. NGINX UI shows only images served
  from your repository's GitHub host, the catalog or the host of your
  packages. The catalog mirrors every listed screenshot to
  `plugin-media.nginxui.com` and lists it from there.
- Store texts and screenshots kept apart from `plugin.json` live in
  `plugin.store.json` next to it (`schema/store.schema.json`); the catalog
  reads it at the tag of the listed release, with no setting. `store` is for
  the two other places: the repository's default branch, so texts change
  without a release, or `store/<id>/` here, for plugins without a public
  repository. The developer portal sets it: the default branch as soon as
  the author asks, the catalog after a review. Leave it out otherwise.

## What `.github/workflows/validate.yml` checks

On every pull request touching `plugins/*.json`, for each changed or added
entry:

1. **Schema**: `node scripts/validate.mjs`. The entry matches
   `schema/entry.schema.json`, the file is named `<id>.json`, the id is
   unique catalog-wide, `repository_url` is a GitHub repository (for an
   `io.github.<owner>.<name>` id, owned by `<owner>`), and a `community`
   entry has an `author_public_key`.
2. **Releases**: `scripts/build-catalog.mjs` builds the entry from your
   GitHub Releases. For every release the published catalog does not list
   yet, and for the newest one, it downloads every package, checks it
   against the sha256 GitHub records for the asset and extracts it. Both
   `plugin.sums` and `plugin.sums.minisig` must sit at the package root,
   every regular file besides them must be listed in `plugin.sums` with a
   matching digest, and `plugin.sums.minisig` must verify against the key of
   the entry's trust level: for a `community` entry a signing key that the
   signer certificate in the package names, that your `author_public_key`
   certified for this plugin and that `revoked_signers` does not list; the
   partner certificate or `partners/` for a `verified` one (see
   [Partner plugins](#partner-plugins)); the official plugin key for an
   `official` one. The job summary lists what the entry will show.
3. **Lint and conformance**: runs `nginx-ui plugin lint` and
   `nginx-ui plugin conformance` against the package a linux-amd64 host would
   install (`downloads["linux-amd64"]`, `downloads["any"]`, or the portable
   package, in that order) inside the `uozicoder/nginx-ui` container image.

A release that does not verify is left out of the catalog, and the pull
request is not mergeable until the newest release verifies.

## Review and merge

A maintainer reviews the submission once, with the checks and the listing
preview in front of them:

1. The repository agrees to be listed: the submission check passed, or the
   owners confirmed it.
2. The name does not pass the plugin off as another one or as the Nginx UI
   project's.
3. The permissions and capabilities fit what the plugin does, and
   `permission_reasons` explain them.
4. The README and the screenshots are about the plugin and follow the code
   of conduct.
5. The license and the categories fit.

An approved submission is merged. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` then builds the catalog and deploys it, and
your plugin is live at the default catalog URL within the cache time of
nginx-ui hosts (`internal/plugin.Marketplace` caches a source for up to one
hour, or refreshes at once for a user who hits "refresh"). Later releases
are not reviewed one by one: the deploy lists them, and the maintainers look
over the listing changes it reports.

## Keeping your listing up to date

Nothing to do: the deploy reads your GitHub Releases every hour and lists a
new one as soon as its packages verify. Prereleases are listed too, on the
channel their version names, see the channel rules in the README. A draft
release is ignored until it is published.

### What your releases change

The listing follows the release it is shown with, the newest stable release
that is not yanked, or the newest release while there is no stable one:

| Listing | From that release |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `name` and `i18n.<language>.name` of `plugin.json`, once a maintainer approved it, see below. |
| Description | `description` and `i18n.<language>.description` of `plugin.json`, unless it claims to be official, see below. |
| Homepage | `homepage_url` of `plugin.json` |
| README | `README.md` at the tag of the release |
| Icon | the file `icon_path` of `plugin.json` names in the package, PNG, WebP or SVG of at most 256 KB, which the catalog serves |
| Screenshots | `screenshots` of `plugin.json`, read from your repository at the tag, see [Manifest](https://nginxui.com/plugin/manifest#screenshots) |

A name can claim to be official in any language, so every name is reviewed,
English included. The listing shows the names of your entry. When a release
names your plugin in a way your entry does not hold, in any language, the
deploy hands the new names to the maintainers in the developer portal, where
you can follow the review. A maintainer approves the names to list, which
adds them to your entry, or declines the rest; until then the listing keeps
the names it had. A name holding a word such as "official" or "官方", or a
character that does not show, is left out.

Descriptions are not reviewed. One that names Nginx UI and claims to be
official in the same sentence, such as "the official Nginx UI DNS plugin",
or holds a character that does not show, is left out, the listing keeps the
description it had, and the developer portal says so. "The official
Cloudflare API" is fine.

The official plugins of the Nginx UI project take their names and
descriptions from their releases directly.

A field your entry sets wins: per language for the description, as a whole
for the others. Maintainers use this to correct a listing. The
deploy lists every entry whose listing changed in its job summary, and the
maintainers look over the changes after the fact.

### Withdrawing a signing key

To replace a signing key, run `nginx-ui plugin key rotate` and sign your next
release with the new one, nothing changes here. When a signing key may have
leaked, open a pull request that adds its id to `revoked_signers` of your
entry; `nginx-ui plugin key revoke signing.pub` prints the line. Every
release that key signed is then yanked and hosts treat its packages as
unsigned, so publish a new release signed with a new key.

To have a release listed within minutes of publishing it instead, install the
[NGINX UI Plugin Catalog](https://github.com/apps/nginx-ui-plugin-catalog)
GitHub App: choose the account that owns the plugin repository, select only
that repository, and install. Publishing a release then starts the deploy of
the catalog at once. The App only receives release events and holds no
private key, so it cannot read your repository, and it does nothing for a
repository the catalog does not list yet. See
[`worker/README.md`](worker/README.md).

A listed release is pinned: replacing a package of it on GitHub fails the
deploy instead of changing what hosts download. Publish a new version
instead.

## Partner plugins

`verified` trust is reserved for partner organizations the maintainers
vouch for. It says who published a package and makes no claim that anyone
reviewed its source.

1. The partner contacts the nginx-ui maintainers. Once agreed, it generates
   a minisign key pair (`minisign -G -p partner.pub -s partner.key`) and
   sends only its public key, `partner.pub`.
2. The maintainers add `partners/<name>.json` with that key, which lists it
   in the signed partner keyring `v1/partners.json`, and send back a
   partner certificate: `plugin.partner` (the partner's public key) and
   `plugin.partner.minisig` (an official plugin key signature over it that names the
   partner and, optionally, an expiry date). See "Issuing a partner
   certificate" in `docs/signing.md`.
3. The partner puts both files, unchanged, at the root of every package
   before writing `plugin.sums`, so `plugin.sums` lists them like any other
   file, and signs `plugin.sums` with its own key as usual.
4. Its catalog entries use `"trust": "verified"` and need no
   `author_public_key`.

Hosts install such a package as `verified` when the certificate verifies
against the official plugin key they pin, or when their copy of the keyring lists
the key. No nginx-ui release is involved. If the key may have leaked, tell
the maintainers through a private security advisory: they revoke it in
`partners/`, and hosts stop treating it as a partner key on their next
catalog refresh, certificate or not. Revocation is the main safeguard. The
maintainers still recommend a long expiry on the certificate, because a
host that never refreshes the keyring would otherwise trust a leaked key
forever. A certificate with an expiry stops working after that date, so ask
the maintainers for a new one before then.

## Yank procedure

Yanking withdraws a specific release, not the whole plugin: its version goes
into the `yanked` list of `plugins/<id>.json`, and the catalog keeps the
release marked `"yanked": true`. A yanked release:

- Is never offered as the `installable_release` to a node that has not
  already installed it.
- Is still reported to a node that already has it installed, as
  `installed_yanked: true`, so the UI can prompt the user to update or
  remove it.

To yank a release:

1. Open an Issue or a security advisory describing the problem (a
   vulnerability, a broken build, a credential leak, a license violation,
   etc.). Do not put exploit details in a public Issue, use a private
   security advisory instead for anything actively exploitable.
2. A maintainer (or the plugin author, for their own plugin) opens a PR
   adding the version to `"yanked"`. Do not delete the GitHub Release: a
   node that already installed it still needs to see it in the catalog to
   know it should update.
3. Merge fast-tracks past the normal release cadence for security issues;
   the deploy republishes the catalog on merge.
4. If every listed release of a plugin ends up yanked, consider whether the
   plugin should be removed from `plugins/` entirely instead (a separate PR,
   discussed with maintainers first).

A yank does not require the author's consent when the issue is a security
one; maintainers may yank unilaterally and notify the author afterward.
